# School-Rust
Projects that I do in school with C#, but with Rust. This way I'm learning my favourite programing language Rust.

The PDF file can be found [here](src/AA11%20-%20ora01%20-%20feladatok%20â€“%20.pdf). Beware that it is in **hungarian** and you might need a translator.

Why are you seeing this shit? Cuz why the hell not? These are just random school projects...
